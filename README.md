# Algorithm Challenge #4 – Sum Each Column in a 3x3 Matrix (Level 3)

🧮 Problem Description  
-
This program generates a 3x3 matrix of random numbers, prints it, andcalculates the sum of each column.  

The challenge emphasizes **column-wise traversal** and modular function design for clarity and maintainability.

---

💡 What You’ll Learn
-
- Traversing a 2D array column by column
- Writing reusable and modular functions
- Separating computation from presentation
- Applying structured algorithmic thinking (Level 3)
- Clean C++ coding practices

---

🧩 Example Output
-
The following is a 3x3 Random Matrix:

 12   45   30  
  8   19   67  
 22   14   10  

The following are the sum of each column:
Column 1 Sum = 42  
Column 2 Sum = 78  
Column 3 Sum = 107
